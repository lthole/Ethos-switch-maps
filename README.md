# Ethos-switch-maps
An Inkscape template for creating Ethos switch maps showing each model's control assignments.

The template looks like this:

This is an example for my Ng2 glider:
![ng 2m_example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf522c1d-4ac5-4dd2-99a3-18156efa92bd)

You can find instructions in the 'instructions' folder.

Examples are in the 'examples' folder. These are not suitable for loading in a radio, because they have a background layer.

Sample maps are in the 'maps' folder. The .svg source files can be mopdified in Inkscape. The .png files can be loaded to the bitmaps/user folder on your radio, and then viewed using a full screen Bitmap widget.
